Projects
Super awesome project
github.com/sproogen

This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

I started this project as a way if learning React and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I’m very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don’t have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
